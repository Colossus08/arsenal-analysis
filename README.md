# arsenal-analysis

Hello! So I wrote an article on medium, analysing the 22-23 season of Arsenal from a perspective of data analytics, the link of which you will find [here](https://medium.com/@message4aaron/decoding-arsenals-22-23-season-with-data-science-and-analysis-27c90528bd15) and made use of libraries like pandas and seaborn to illustrate the observations that were made. The code provided here is basically the notebook which contains the snippets of code that I used in the article. I took the approach of copying the html code for a table and then using pd.read_html method. so initially there are html code tables of 21-22 season, after which i created variables and basically performed EDA to make sure these variables which are dataframes contain only data I need. And i have done the same for the 22-23 season tables too. so the order of code is, 
- html code of tables from  21-22 season
- dataframes and eda on the same tables
- html code of tables from 22-23 season
- dataframes and eda on the same tables
- finally, code snippets that were used in the article

be sure, to let me know what u think about the article as well as the code. cheers:)
